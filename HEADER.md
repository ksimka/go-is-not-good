## Motivation

Seems like complaining about **go**'s flaws is becoming a trend. Any newbie must have a chance to read all the **go**-is-bad arguments before they go too far. So here it is.

## What it's for

This repo is not aimed to offend or insult someone (at least not more than each author does it in its article), especially **golang** itself, its authors and the community. It is for educational purpose only. Any contributor can have an absolutely different point of view.

I don't think anyone would deny that **go** has weaknesses: it certainly has. But how do you know, *is it really a language design flaw or is it just you, doing something completely wrong*? This list here to help you quickly answer the question.

## How to use it

You're writing some code. And suddenly you understand you need something that language can't give you. You go here and check if you're the one with that issue or not. If it's a common issue, it'll be here. Then you decide what to do: choose another tool for your task or go find a better solution or a workaround.
